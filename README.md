## Meeting Goals

The `fin-agent` was specifically architected to answer complex, multi-step financial questions. Here is a direct mapping of the example prompts to the features and tools built to solve them:

| Assignment Prompt Example | How `fin-agent` Solves It | Key Technologies / Tools Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `"Summarize Spotify's latest conference call."` | The agent resolves `Spotify` ‚Üí `SPOT`, lists available transcripts, and fetches the latest one to summarize. | `resolveSymbol` ‚Üí `getTranscript` |
| `"What has Airbnb management said about profitability..."` | The agent uses the advanced `searchTranscripts` tool, which searches across multiple historical calls for a specific topic and provides a ranked summary of mentions. | `searchTranscripts`, AI Topic Expansion |
| `"What are Mark Zuckerberg's and Satya Nadella's recent comments about AI?"` | This showcases the cross-company and executive-filtering capabilities of the `searchTranscripts` tool. The agent identifies both companies and executives in the prompt. | `searchTranscripts` (multi-company) |
| `"How many new large deals did ServiceNow sign in the last quarter?"` | The agent uses `searchTranscripts` with a `lookbackQuarters=1` parameter to narrow the search to the most recent earnings call. | `searchTranscripts` (time-bound) |
| `‚ÄúWhat was Crowdstrike revenue in the past 3, 5, and 10 years‚Äù` | The agent resolves the company and uses the `getStatement` tool to fetch the income statement for the required number of years. | `resolveSymbol` ‚Üí `getStatement` |
| `‚ÄúWhat was Crowdstrikes revenue growth in the past 3, 5, and 10 years‚Äù` | The agent uses the purpose-built `getFinancialGrowth` tool, demonstrating it can select the most efficient tool for a specific financial concept like "growth". | `resolveSymbol` ‚Üí `getFinancialGrowth` |

This agentic, tool-chaining approach ensures the system can robustly handle a wide variety of "random" companies and financial questions as required.

## Core Features

*   **Agentic AI:** Unlike simple chatbots, fin-agent uses a multi-step "Planner" agent that can think, reason, and chain multiple tools together to answer complex queries.
*   **Comprehensive Financial Tools:** Access a wide range of real-time financial data through integrated tools:
    *   **Company Search:** Resolve company names to ticker symbols (`resolveSymbol`).
    *   **Stock Quotes:** Get the latest stock prices (`getQuote`).
    *   **Financial Statements:** Fetch income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements (`getStatement`).
    *   **Growth & Metrics:** Pull historical financial growth and key metrics (`getFinancialGrowth`, `getKeyMetrics`).
    *   **Earnings Transcripts:** Retrieve full earnings call transcripts by quarter and year (`getTranscript`).
*   **Advanced Multi-Transcript Analysis:** The `searchTranscripts` tool is a powerhouse. It can:
    *   Search for specific topics across multiple earnings calls for one or more companies.
    *   Filter comments by specific executives (e.g., "What has Satya Nadella said about AI?").
    *   Use AI-powered topic expansion to find related keywords and improve search recall.
    *   Intelligently summarize and rank the most relevant mentions.
*   **Streaming Responses:** Answers stream in token-by-token using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for a real-time, responsive user experience.
*   **Reasoning Transparency:** Every AI-powered response includes a "Reasoning" dropdown that shows the exact tools the agent used, the parameters it chose, and the results it got back, providing full transparency into the AI's thought process.
*   **Persistent Chat History:** Conversations are automatically saved to `localStorage`, allowing you to manage multiple chats and pick up where you left off.
*   **Modern UI/UX:** A responsive interface with a dark mode toggle for comfortable viewing.

## Technical Showcase & Architecture

This project was made with **separation of concerns**, **maintainability**, and **modern development patterns** in mind.

### Backend: The Agentic Core (`/app/api/chat`)

The backend is a single Next.js API Route that orchestrates the entire AI agentic workflow. It's designed to be modular and easy to extend.

1.  **Orchestrator (`route.ts`):** The main API endpoint that manages the agent's loop. It does not contain any business logic itself.
2.  **Planner Agent:** On each loop, a "Planner" LLM call (using GPT-4.1-mini) analyzes the conversation history and decides which tool to use next, if any.
3.  **Service Layer:**
    *   **Tool Executor (`tool.executor.ts`):** A dedicated service that handles the raw data fetching. It takes a tool name and arguments and calls the appropriate external API (e.g., Financial Modeling Prep).
    *   **Tool Processor (`tool.processor.ts`):** This service takes the raw JSON from the executor and transforms it into a clean, structured, and LLM-friendly format. This separates data fetching from data transformation.
    *   **Transcript Searcher (`transcript.searcher.ts`):** The most complex tool's logic is fully encapsulated in its own service, keeping the executor clean.
4.  **Synthesizer Agent:** After the tool loop is complete, a final "Synthesizer" LLM call is made with the full context (original question + all tool results) to generate the final, user-facing answer.
5.  **Streaming via SSE:** The final response is streamed back to the client using the `ReadableStream` API for a real-time feel.

### Frontend: A Hook-Based Approach (`/components`, `/hooks`)

The frontend was refactored from a single monolithic component into a scalable, component-based architecture powered by custom hooks.

1.  **State Management via Custom Hooks:** All complex state logic is abstracted into two primary hooks:
    *   **`useChatHistory()`:** Manages the global state of all conversations, including loading/saving to `localStorage` and handling the creation, deletion, and selection of chats.
    *   **`useChat()`:** Manages the state of the *active* conversation, including the message list, user input, loading state, and the API call lifecycle.
2.  **Component Hierarchy:**
    *   **`ChatInterface.tsx`:** The top-level "Orchestrator" component. It calls the hooks and passes state and handlers down to its children. It contains no complex logic itself.
    *   **Child Components (`/components/chat`):** The UI is broken down into small, single-responsibility components (`MessageList`, `ChatMessage`, `ChatInput`, `ReasoningDisplay`, etc.), making the codebase easy to navigate and maintain.
3.  **API Communication (`/services`):** The client-side `fetch` logic for the SSE stream is isolated in a dedicated service, separating it from component logic.

This architecture ensures the application is not only functional but also clean, testable, and easy to build upon.

## Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **AI:** OpenAI API (GPT-4.1-mini)
*   **Financial Data:** Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API
*   **Backend:** Next.js API Routes (Serverless Functions)
*   **Linting/Formatting:** ESLint & Prettier

## A Note on API Access and Citations

This application was built using the public Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API key provided in the assignment brief. Free-tier API keys have certain limitations (e.g., full data is often only available for a small set of symbols like `AAPL` or `MSFT`).

**Therefore, while the citation links (`üîó`) in the chat interface are programmatically correct, they may not always resolve to a page with data.**

The **purpose of this feature** is to demonstrate the architectural principle of **data source transparency**. Each citation link accurately reflects the specific API endpoint the AI agent called to get its information. In a production environment with a full-access enterprise API key, these links would seamlessly connect the user to the raw data source, enhancing trust and verifiability.

## Future Improvements

While this is a fully functional application, here are a few ways it could be extended:

*   **Stream Reasoning:** Stream the reasoning steps to the UI in real-time as the agent executes them, giving the user instant feedback on the agent's progress.
*   **Enhanced Error Handling:** Display more user-friendly error messages on the frontend when an API call or tool execution fails.
*   **Unit & E2E Testing:** Implement unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library for hooks and components, and add end-to-end tests with Playwright or Cypress to ensure core user flows are never broken.
*   **More Advanced Tools:** Add new tools for more complex analysis, such as:
    *   A tool to calculate and compare financial ratios (P/E, Debt-to-Equity).
    *   A tool to generate charts or graphs using a library like Recharts.
*   **Token & Cost Management:** Implement a token counter to estimate the cost of each query and set limits to prevent expensive API calls.
